# OpenYoke
A place for me to share my Design ponderings of a Yoke for Flight Sims

# Design Goals

* Easy to build
* Relatively cheap. No use of Expensive Servo motors.
* Easy to obtain parts, via Ebay, Amazon, Aliexpress, Hardware Stores (e.g. Lowes, Home Depot, Bunnings, Homebase)
* 3D Printed Components
* Force Feedback
* Not be Stupidly overbuilt, no need to OpenBuild, or Alu Extrusion.
